## Privacy policy

Revision from September 22, 2025.

### Definitions

- **Company**: imput LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of
  Wyoming, in the United States.
- **Maintainers**: Representatives of the Company acting on its behalf, whose goal is to develop and
  improve Helium and/or Services.
- **Helium**: The open-source browser developed primarily by the Maintainers. Its source code is
  available in the following repositories: [helium](https://github.com/imputnet/helium),
  [helium-macos](https://github.com/imputnet/helium-macos),
  [helium-linux](https://github.com/imputnet/helium-linux) and/or
  [helium-windows](https://github.com/imputnet/helium-windows).
- **Services**: Network-based services developed primarily by the Maintainers and hosted exclusively
  by the Company, whose source code is available in the
  [helium-services](https://github.com/imputnet/helium-services) repository.
- **Website**: The website (helium.computer) where this privacy policy is displayed.

### Privacy policy

Helium does not make any network requests, including to the Services, unless such requests are the
result of user actions (for example, visiting a website or installing an extension) or are part of
features that the user has explicitly enabled or configured during setup. If Helium is making any
network requests without your consent, please
[file a bug report](https://github.com/imputnet/helium/issues).

<br>

All browsing data managed by Helium is stored locally on your device. You have full control over it
and can delete or modify it at any time. Neither the Company nor the Maintainers have access to this
data.

<br>

Services do not collect, store, or share any personal information. Certain non-identifiable
technical information (e.g., anonymized server logs) may be retained for no longer than 24 hours to
detect and prevent abuse or to improve the Services. We do not share this information with third
parties under any circumstances.

<br>

We use Cloudflare for content delivery and protection of our Website. For more information about
Cloudflare, refer to the [Third-party providers](#third-party-providers) section.

<br>

Our Website may load a Plausible Analytics script hosted on a server owned and managed by the
Company. We use Plausible to collect anonymized traffic analytics. Our Plausible instance does not
store any identifying information about you. You can read more about Plausible
[on their website](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics).

<br>

This privacy policy does not apply to third-party or unofficial builds of Helium or derivatives,
instances of the Services not operated by the Company, or non-production deployments of Services
used by Maintainers to develop and improve the Services.

### Miscellaneous legal disclaimers

This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the State of Wyoming, United States, without regard
to conflict of law principles. By using Helium or the Services, you consent to the processing of
information in the United States and/or the European Union, which may have data protection laws
different from those in your country. Since Helium, or the Services, generally do not collect
personal information, rights under GDPR, CCPA, and similar laws may not be applicable. However, if
you believe we hold any personal data about you, you may contact us to request access, correction,
or deletion. We will respond as required under applicable law.

<br>

Helium and the Services are not directed at children under 13 (or the minimum age in your
jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

<br>

We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Significant changes will be
announced on our website, GitHub, or social media channels. Continued use of Helium or the Services
after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.

### Security

The Services currently run inside virtual machines with full-disk encryption. For communication with
the Services, Helium uses the TLS 1.3 protocol. While we take reasonable measures to protect the
Services and associated infrastructure, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100%
secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

### Third-party providers

- **Cloudflare**: Used for the Website and for content delivery of software updates
  (updates.helium.computer). Cloudflare does not process data from the Services. Use of Cloudflare
  services is also subject to the
  [Cloudflare Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).
- **GitHub**: Used for storing and collaborating around Helium sources, and used as the source of
  truth for Helium releases. Use of GitHub is subject to the
  [GitHub General Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

If we engage additional providers that users may come into contact with, we will update this section
accordingly.
