### Open-source rights

Helium is licensed under the GPL-3.0 license, with some imported content being also licensed under
the BSD-3-Clause license. You are allowed to use the Software and its source code under the
conditions of these licenses. You can review the licenses in their entirety in any of the Helium
repositories on GitHub:

- [helium](https://github.com/imputnet/helium)
- [helium-macos](https://github.com/imputnet/helium-macos)
- [helium-linux](https://github.com/imputnet/helium-linux)

- [helium-services](https://github.com/imputnet/helium-services)
- [helium-onboarding](https://github.com/imputnet/helium-onboarding)

Copies of all open-source licenses, including Helium's own, are also shipped with the Software
itself and can be reviewed at any time at `helium://credits/`

### Disclaimer of warranty

There is no warranty for the Software, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Except when
otherwise stated in writing, the Company, Maintainers, and/or other parties provide the Software "AS
IS" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied. This includes, but is not limited to,
the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk
regarding the quality and performance of the Software rests with you. Should the Software prove
defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.

### Limitation of liability

In no event – unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing – will any Maintainers,
copyright holders (such as the Company), or any other party who modifies and/or conveys the Software
as permitted above be liable to you for damages. This includes any general, special, incidental, or
consequential damages arising from the use of or inability to use the Software. Such damages
encompass, but are not limited to, loss of data, data inaccuracies, losses sustained by you or third
parties, or the Software's failure to operate with other software — even if the liable party was
advised of the possibility of these damages.

### Donations

By making a financial contribution ("donation") to support the development or maintenance of the
Software, you acknowledge and agree that:

1. All donations are made voluntarily and without expectation of any goods, services, or other
   benefits in return. Donations do not constitute a purchase, investment, or any form of
   consideration for current or future services.

2. All donations are final and non-refundable, regardless of whether the Software's development
   continues, is modified, suspended, or discontinued.

3. A donation does not grant you any ownership, intellectual property rights, or other legal
   interests in the Software, its source code, or related projects.

4. Donations may be used at the sole discretion of the Company to support the development,
   maintenance, or related operational costs of the Software.

5. Maintainers and/or the Company are under no obligation to act upon suggestions, requests, or
   expectations made by donors, unless explicitly agreed upon in writing.

### Changes to these terms

We reserve the right to update Terms of Use from time to time. Significant changes will be announced
on our Website, GitHub, or social media channels. Continued use of Helium or the Services after
changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
